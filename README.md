Peer Reviewed By: Harrison Busby: "Ken's program is excellent. You can really tell that its extremely organized, and very easy to read. It shows his incredible attention to detail. I really liked how when he used his string arrays to list his restaurants, that he made them super easy to be able to ready. Overall, excellent code and excellent work. Good job Ken! :)
